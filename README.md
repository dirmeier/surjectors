> Surjection layers for density estimation with normalizing flows

## About

Surjectors is a light-weight library for density estimation using
inference and generative surjective normalizing flows, i.e., flows can that reduce or increase dimensionality.
Surjectors builds on Distrax and Haiku and is fully compatible with both of them.

Surjectors makes use of

- Haiku`s module system for neural networks,
- Distrax for probability distributions and some base bijectors,
- Optax for gradient-based optimization,
- JAX for autodiff and XLA computation.

## Examples

You can, for instance, construct a simple normalizing flow like this:

```python
import distrax
import haiku as hk
from jax import numpy as jnp, random as jr
from surjectors import Slice, LULinear, Chain
from surjectors import TransformedDistribution
from surjectors.nn import make_mlp

def decoder_fn(n_dim):
    def _fn(z):
        params = make_mlp([32, 32, n_dim * 2])(z)
        means, log_scales = jnp.split(params, 2, -1)
        return distrax.Independent(distrax.Normal(means, jnp.exp(log_scales)))
    return _fn

@hk.without_apply_rng
@hk.transform
def flow(x):
    base_distribution = distrax.Independent(
        distrax.Normal(jnp.zeros(5), jnp.ones(5)), 1
    )
    transform = Chain([Slice(5, decoder_fn(5)), LULinear(5)])
    pushforward = TransformedDistribution(base_distribution, transform)
    return pushforward.log_prob(x)

x = jr.normal(jr.PRNGKey(1), (1, 10))
params = flow.init(jr.PRNGKey(2), x)
lp = flow.apply(params, x)
```
